# Canny Batch Shape Creation Tool - Implementation Summary

## Problem Identified
When asking Canny to create patterns like "draw a circle outline using circles", it would only create shapes in a horizontal line. This was because:

1. The `createShape` tool with `count` parameter places all shapes in a horizontal line with fixed 120px spacing
2. Canny could specify x,y for individual shapes, but would need multiple separate API calls (inefficient)
3. No tool existed for creating multiple shapes at specific positions in one call

## Solution: New `createShapesBatch` Tool

### What It Does
Allows Canny to create multiple shapes with **specific x,y coordinates** in a **single function call**, perfect for:
- Drawing patterns (circle outlines, spirals, grids)
- Creating arrangements based on visual analysis
- Precise multi-shape layouts
- Any scenario requiring calculated positions

### Files Modified

#### 1. `/src/utils/canvasTools.js`
**Added:**
- New tool definition `createShapesBatch` with array of shape specifications
- Handler function `handleCreateShapesBatch()` that:
  - Validates shape count (max 50 per call, max 1000 total on canvas)
  - Creates each shape at its specified x,y position
  - Applies boundary constraints (0-5000 canvas limits)
  - Supports all shape types (rectangle, circle, polygon, text, customPolygon)
  - Returns success/failure stats

**Tool Definition:**
```javascript
{
  name: 'createShapesBatch',
  description: 'Create multiple shapes at specific positions in a single call...',
  parameters: {
    shapes: [
      {
        shapeType: 'circle',
        x: 500,
        y: 500,
        radius: 30,
        color: '#ff0000'
      },
      // ... more shapes
    ]
  }
}
```

#### 2. `/api/chat.js` (Backend)
**Added:**
- Tool definition for OpenAI function calling
- Updated system prompt to:
  - Explain the new tool and when to use it
  - Provide examples (circle outlines, smiley faces, etc.)
  - Clarify that `createShape` uses count for horizontal lines
  - Show trigonometry examples for circular patterns

**Key Examples in Prompt:**
- "Draw a circle outline using small circles" → Use createShapesBatch with 12 circles at calculated angles
- "Draw a smiley face" → Use createShapesBatch for eyes, mouth arc, etc.

#### 3. Text Box Improvements (Bonus)
While working on this, also fixed text box issues:
- `/src/components/TextBox.jsx`: Made entire text box area clickable (not just border)
- Set default border to none for new text boxes
- Updated Canvas.jsx and canvasTools.js to apply this default

## How It Works

### Example: Drawing a Circle Outline
When user asks: "Draw a circle outline using 12 small circles"

**Canny will:**
1. Calculate 12 positions around a circle using trigonometry:
   ```
   For i = 0 to 11:
     angle = (i * 30) degrees  // 360/12 = 30
     x = centerX + radius * cos(angle)
     y = centerY + radius * sin(angle)
   ```

2. Call `createShapesBatch` with one array:
   ```javascript
   {
     shapes: [
       { shapeType: 'circle', x: 600, y: 500, radius: 20, color: '#646cff' },
       { shapeType: 'circle', x: 650, y: 550, radius: 20, color: '#646cff' },
       // ... 10 more circles at calculated positions
     ]
   }
   ```

3. All 12 circles are created in **one API call** at their **exact positions**

## Benefits

1. **Efficient**: One API call instead of many
2. **Precise**: Exact positioning control
3. **Flexible**: Supports all shape types and properties
4. **Safe**: Built-in limits and boundary constraints
5. **Vision-Compatible**: Canny can see the canvas and calculate positions relative to existing shapes

## Testing Suggestions

Try these prompts with Canny:
- "Draw a circle outline using 10 small circles"
- "Create a smiley face with circles for eyes and mouth"
- "Draw a star pattern using rectangles"
- "Create a spiral of circles"
- "Draw a flower with circles"

## Technical Notes

- Maximum 50 shapes per batch call (safety limit)
- Canvas boundaries automatically enforced (0-5000 x, 0-5000 y)
- Each shape gets unique timestamp for proper ordering
- Supports all existing shape types and properties
- Error handling for individual shape failures
- Compatible with existing undo/redo system
