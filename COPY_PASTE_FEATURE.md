# Copy/Paste Keyboard Shortcuts - Implementation Summary

## Feature Overview
Added standard copy/paste keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+C / Ctrl+V on Windows/Linux, Cmd+C / Cmd+V on Mac) as an alternative to the existing duplication tool (Ctrl+D / Cmd+D).

## Functionality

### Copy (Ctrl/Cmd + C)
- **What it does**: Copies currently selected shape(s) to an internal clipboard
- **Works with**: 
  - Single selected shape
  - Multiple selected shapes
- **Behavior**:
  - Stores full shape data (position, size, color, rotation, etc.)
  - Removes ID, timestamp, and lock info (new ones generated on paste)
  - Clipboard persists until next copy operation
  - Console logs: `ðŸ“‹ COPY KEY PRESSED` and confirmation

### Paste (Ctrl/Cmd + V)
- **What it does**: Creates new shapes from clipboard with 20px offset
- **Works with**: Any shapes previously copied
- **Behavior**:
  - Creates new shapes offset by 20px (x+20, y+20) from clipboard position
  - Automatically selects the newly pasted shapes
  - Updates clipboard offset for repeated pasting (paste again for another +20px)
  - Respects viewer permissions (viewers cannot paste)
  - Console logs: `ðŸ“‹ PASTE KEY PRESSED` and confirmation

### Smart Repeated Pasting
The clipboard updates after each paste to increment the offset, so:
1. Copy a shape at (100, 100)
2. Paste â†’ Creates at (120, 120)
3. Paste again â†’ Creates at (140, 140)
4. Paste again â†’ Creates at (160, 160)

This makes it easy to create patterns or distributed copies!

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified
**`/src/components/Canvas.jsx`**

1. **Added clipboard state** (line ~152):
   ```javascript
   const [clipboard, setClipboard] = useState([]);
   ```

2. **Copy handler** (lines ~2096-2121):
   - Triggered by Ctrl/Cmd + C
   - Extracts selected shapes
   - Removes ID, timestamp, lock fields
   - Stores in clipboard state

3. **Paste handler** (lines ~2123-2186):
   - Triggered by Ctrl/Cmd + V
   - Checks viewer permissions
   - Creates new shapes with 20px offset
   - Updates clipboard for next paste
   - Auto-selects pasted shapes

### Keyboard Shortcuts Summary

| Shortcut | Action | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| Ctrl/Cmd + C | Copy | Copy selected shape(s) to clipboard |
| Ctrl/Cmd + V | Paste | Paste from clipboard with offset |
| Ctrl/Cmd + D | Duplicate | Duplicate & offset (original feature) |
| Delete/Backspace | Delete | Delete selected shape(s) |

## Safety Features

âœ… **Viewer Protection**: Viewers can copy but cannot paste (read-only)  
âœ… **State Guards**: Won't trigger during drawing, dragging, resizing, rotating, or selecting  
âœ… **Event Prevention**: Prevents default browser behavior (e.g., paste into text fields)  
âœ… **Deselection**: Automatically deselects before pasting to avoid confusion  
âœ… **Lock Removal**: Pasted shapes aren't locked even if original was  

## User Experience Benefits

1. **Familiar UX**: Standard copy/paste shortcuts work as expected
2. **Persistent Clipboard**: Copy once, paste multiple times
3. **Pattern Creation**: Repeated paste with auto-offset makes patterns easy
4. **Multi-shape Support**: Copy/paste groups of shapes together
5. **Cross-platform**: Works with both Ctrl (Windows/Linux) and Cmd (Mac)
6. **Non-destructive**: Original shapes remain unchanged

## Testing Suggestions

Try these workflows:
- Select a shape â†’ Ctrl+C â†’ Ctrl+V â†’ Paste again to create a diagonal line
- Multi-select shapes â†’ Ctrl+C â†’ Ctrl+V â†’ Creates grouped copy
- Copy from one area, pan to another, paste there
- Copy, delete original, paste to move with undo capability
- Copy, paste multiple times to create patterns
