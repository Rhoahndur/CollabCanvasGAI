# Deployment Summary: Vercel Serverless Architecture

## What Changed?

We converted the Express backend (`server.js`) to a **Vercel Serverless Function** for secure production deployment.

## Architecture Comparison

### Before (Express Server)
```
Frontend (Vite) ----HTTP----> Express Server (localhost:3001)
                              â†“
                              OpenAI API
```
**Problem**: API key exposure risk, need to deploy backend separately

### After (Vercel Serverless)
```
Frontend (Vite) ----HTTP----> Vercel Serverless Function (/api/chat)
                              â†“
                              OpenAI API
```
**Solution**: Everything deploys together, API key stays secure on Vercel!

## Files Added/Modified

### New Files
- `api/chat.js` - Vercel serverless function for Canny AI
- `VERCEL_CANNY_DEPLOYMENT.md` - Deployment guide
- `.env.example` - Environment variables template

### Modified Files
- `src/components/ChatPanel.jsx` - Auto-detects dev vs prod
- `vercel.json` - Routes API requests to serverless function

### Unchanged (Still Works!)
- All canvas features (shapes, text, images, multi-select)
- Firebase Realtime Database
- Firebase Auth
- Real-time collaboration
- Cursors and presence
- Everything else! âœ…

## Key Points

âœ… **Nothing breaks**: All existing features continue to work  
âœ… **Secure**: API keys stored as Vercel environment variables  
âœ… **Simple**: No separate backend deployment needed  
âœ… **Flexible**: Can still develop locally with Express server  

## Local Development (Unchanged)

You can keep developing exactly as before:

```bash
# Terminal 1
npm run dev

# Terminal 2
npm run server
```

The `ChatPanel` automatically uses `localhost:3001` in development.

## Production Deployment

When you deploy to Vercel:
1. Frontend + API function deploy together
2. Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` in Vercel dashboard
3. Canny works automatically at `/api/chat`

## What About server.js?

`server.js` is **not deployed** to Vercel, but it's still useful for:
- Local development
- Testing changes before deployment
- Debugging API issues

It's perfectly fine to keep it in the repo!

## Next Steps

1. Test locally: `npm run dev` + `npm run server`
2. If working, deploy to Vercel: `vercel --prod`
3. Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` in Vercel dashboard
4. Test Canny in production! ðŸŽ‰

**TL;DR**: We didn't break anything, we just made deployment easier and more secure! ðŸš€
