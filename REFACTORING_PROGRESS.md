# Refactoring Progress Report

## âœ… Phase 1: useCanvas.js - COMPLETE
- âœ… Renamed `rectangles` â†’ `shapes`
- âœ… Renamed `selectedRectId` â†’ `selectedShapeId`
- âœ… Renamed `selectRectangle` â†’ `selectShape`
- âœ… Renamed `deselectRectangle` â†’ `deselectShape`
- âœ… Renamed `selectedRectangle` â†’ `selectedShape`
- âœ… Updated all refs (`selectedRectIdRef` â†’ `selectedShapeIdRef`)
- âœ… Updated comments
- âœ… No linter errors

## ðŸ”„ Phase 2: Canvas.jsx - IN PROGRESS
### Completed:
- âœ… Updated useCanvas destructuring

### Next Steps (continue in next message):
Given the size and complexity of Canvas.jsx (~2700 lines), I recommend:
1. Doing a CAREFUL systematic rename of all variables
2. Testing after each batch of changes
3. Moving to Phase 3-4 after Canvas.jsx is complete

## Key Replacements Needed in Canvas.jsx:
- `rectangles.` â†’ `shapes.`
- `selectedRectId` â†’ `selectedShapeId`
- `selectRectangle(` â†’ `selectShape(`
- `deselectRectangle(` â†’ `deselectShape(`
- `handleRectangle` â†’ `handleShape` (for handler functions)
- Comments mentioning "rectangle" in context of all shapes

## Testing Strategy:
1. After useCanvas complete: âœ… PASSED (no linter errors)
2. After Canvas.jsx: Will test shape creation/movement/deletion
3. After service functions: Will test all CRUD operations
4. Final integration: Full system test

## User Request Summary:
- Systematic refactoring: Option A (complete rename)
- Remove wrapper functions (createRectangle, etc.)
- Add tests for major components
- One-by-one changes with testing

## Current Status:
**Phase 1 Complete, Phase 2 In Progress**

Ready to continue with Canvas.jsx systematic renaming.
