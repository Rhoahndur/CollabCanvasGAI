## What's Left to Build

### ✅ Previously Out of Scope - Now Implemented
These were originally **not** part of the MVP but have been added:
- ✅ Multiple shape types (rectangles, circles, polygons, text boxes)
- ✅ Advanced selection (multi-select, drag-to-select)
- ✅ Transformations (resize, rotate)
- ✅ Delete operations (Delete key)
- ✅ Text editing (inline text editor with double-click)
- ✅ Google OAuth (alongside GitHub)
- ✅ Chat UI (ready for AI agent backend)

### ❌ Still Out of Scope
These features remain intentionally **not** implemented:
- Line shapes (two-point drawing)
- Skew transformation
- Layer management (z-index reordering, grouping)
- Duplicate operation (Ctrl+D)
- Color picker UI (still using pseudorandom colors)
- Advanced text formatting (fonts, sizes, alignment options)
- Undo/redo functionality
- Export/import features (PNG/SVG export)
- Multiple canvas support (workspace concept)
- Canvas sharing/permissions (granular access control)
- AI agent backend (UI ready, logic not connected)

### 🔮 Potential Future Enhancements
These features could be added in future iterations:

#### High Priority
- **AI Chat Backend** - Connect chat panel to AI agent
  - Integrate OpenAI or Anthropic API
  - Define agent capabilities (create shapes, answer questions, modify canvas)
  - Handle streaming responses
  - Context: pass canvas state to AI

- **Duplicate operation** - Duplicate existing shapes
  - UI: Click shape → Ctrl+D or right-click menu
  - Creates new shape with same properties, new ID
  - Position offset to avoid exact overlap

- **Email/password auth** - Traditional authentication option
  - Firebase Auth already supports it
  - Add email/password form to login page
  - Handle password reset flow

#### Medium Priority
- **Line shapes** - Add straight lines
  - New component: `Line.jsx`
  - Different creation UX (click-drag defines endpoints)
  - Locking and selection work similarly
  - Resize by dragging endpoints

- **Arrow shapes** - Lines with arrowheads
  - Extension of line shapes
  - Different arrowhead styles (triangle, circle, diamond)

- **Custom colors** - Let users pick colors
  - Add color picker UI (react-color or similar)
  - Store selected color in user state
  - Apply to new shapes
  - Allow changing color of existing shapes

- **Shape properties panel** - Edit shape properties
  - Width, height, radius, color, rotation
  - Text content, font size
  - Position (x, y coordinates)

#### Lower Priority
- **Undo/redo** - Action history with reversal
  - Complex: requires operational transformation or CRDT
  - Store action history per user
  - Handle conflicts with other users' actions

- **Multiple canvases** - Workspace concept with multiple canvases
  - Firestore already supports this (just add canvasId routing)
  - UI: Sidebar with canvas list
  - Permissions: Who can access which canvas

- **Export to PNG/SVG** - Download canvas as image
  - Use html2canvas or similar
  - Or serialize SVG and trigger download

- **Text objects** - Add text with editing
  - Complex: Need contentEditable or input overlay
  - Text rendering, font selection, alignment

- **Layer management** - z-index reordering
  - UI: Layer panel showing object stack
  - Backend: Add zIndex field to objects
  - Allow reordering via drag-and-drop

#### Experimental
- **AI-powered features** - Shape recognition, auto-layout, suggestions
  - Integrate OpenAI/Anthropic API
  - Smart snap-to-grid, alignment suggestions
  - Natural language shape creation

- **Voice collaboration** - Real-time voice chat
  - Integrate WebRTC or Twilio
  - Presence indicator shows who's talking

- **Commenting system** - Add comments to objects or canvas
  - Similar to Figma comments
  - Thread-based discussions

### 🛠️ Technical Debt
These are technical improvements, not features:

#### Testing
- **Unit tests** - Test utility functions and services
  - Use Jest for pure functions
  - Mock Firestore for service tests

- **Integration tests** - Test React hooks and components
  - Use React Testing Library
  - Mock Firestore with firebase-mock

- **E2E tests** - Test full user flows
  - Use Playwright or Cypress
  - Test multi-user scenarios with multiple browser contexts

#### Code Quality
- **TypeScript migration** - Add static typing
  - Gradual migration: start with new files
  - Convert existing files one at a time
  - Benefits: Better DX, fewer bugs

- **Remove console.log** - Clean up debugging statements
  - Terser removes some in production
  - But better to use proper logging library

- **ESLint setup** - Enforce code style
  - Add ESLint + Prettier
  - Configure rules for React/Firebase

- **Code documentation** - Add JSDoc comments
  - Document complex functions
  - Explain non-obvious patterns

#### Infrastructure
- **CI/CD pipeline** - Automated testing and deployment
  - GitHub Actions workflow
  - Run tests on PR
  - Auto-deploy to staging on merge to main

- **Error tracking** - Production error monitoring
  - Integrate Sentry or LogRocket
  - Track errors and performance issues

- **Analytics** - Usage tracking
  - Add Google Analytics or Mixpanel
  - Track feature usage, performance metrics

- **Staging environment** - Separate Firebase project for testing
  - Test changes before production
  - Prevent breaking production

## Current Issues

### Known Bugs
**None** - No critical or high-priority bugs identified

### Minor UX Issues
- Shape colors are pseudorandom (can't choose specific color)
- No undo if you accidentally create/move something
- Single canvas only (all users in same space)
- No duplicate operation (Ctrl+D)
- Chat panel has no backend logic yet
- Text formatting options limited (no font/size picker)

### Performance Notes
- Viewport culling is critical for performance (without it, FPS drops at 200+ objects)
- React.memo is essential (Rectangle re-renders would kill performance)
- Throttling prevents Firestore spam (cursor updates would overwhelm database)
- Code splitting helps initial load time (React and Firebase are separate bundles)

### Browser Compatibility
- ✅ **Chrome/Edge** - Works perfectly
- ✅ **Firefox** - Works perfectly
- ✅ **Safari** - Works, but IndexedDB setup slower on first load
- ⚠️ **Mobile browsers** - Not optimized for touch (desktop-focused)

## Performance Metrics

### Current Measurements
| Metric | Target | Actual | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Frame Rate | 60 FPS | 60 FPS @ 500 objs | ✅ Met |
