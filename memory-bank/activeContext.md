# Active Context

## Current State
**Status:** ✅ MVP Complete and Deployed  
**Last Major Update:** Production deployment with all features implemented  
**Current Focus:** Maintenance, documentation, and potential enhancement planning

## Recent Changes

### Last Session (Based on Memory)
1. **Auto-deselection on mouse leave** - Fixed issue where selected rectangles kept selection outline after cursor moved away
   - Added `onMouseLeave` handler in `Rectangle.jsx`
   - Added `handleRectangleMouseLeave` callback in `Canvas.jsx`
   - Only deselects if not actively dragging
   - Prevents confusion about which rectangle would be dragged next

2. **Multiple interaction modes** - Clarified and documented canvas interaction patterns
   - Drawing mode: click-drag on empty canvas
   - Pan mode: Shift/Cmd/Ctrl + drag
   - Select mode: click rectangles
   - Drag mode: drag selected rectangles
   - Zoom mode: scroll wheel

3. **Canvas state management** - Optimized rectangle state handling
   - `isDragging` flag prevents premature deselection
   - `selectedRectId` tracks current selection
   - Optimistic updates for smooth dragging
   - Throttled Firestore syncs during drag operations

## Active Work

### Current Sprint: Memory Bank Initialization
**Goal:** Create comprehensive documentation system for future sessions

**Tasks:**
- [x] Read and understand project structure
- [x] Analyze PRD and architecture documentation
- [x] Review implementation in Canvas.jsx and hooks
- [x] Create Memory Bank directory structure
- [x] Write projectbrief.md (foundation document)
- [x] Write productContext.md (why and how)
- [x] Write systemPatterns.md (architecture and patterns)
- [x] Write techContext.md (technologies and setup)
- [ ] Write activeContext.md (this file)
- [ ] Write progress.md (what works and what's left)
- [ ] Create .cursor/rules/ files for project intelligence

### No Active Development Tasks
The MVP is feature-complete. No outstanding bugs or features in active development.

## Next Steps

### Immediate (This Session)
1. ✅ Complete Memory Bank core files
2. ⏳ Create cursor rules files for project-specific patterns
3. ⏳ Document any undocumented edge cases or patterns

### Short-term (Next 1-2 Sessions)
1. Review and validate all Memory Bank documentation
2. Ensure .cursor/rules/ captures all critical patterns
3. Consider creating additional context files if needed
4. Test that Memory Bank provides sufficient context for new tasks

### Medium-term (Future Sessions)
**Potential Enhancement Areas** (not committed):
- Additional shape types (circles, lines, text)
- Delete and duplicate operations
- Multi-select functionality
- Google OAuth and email/password authentication
- Multiple canvas support (workspace concept)
- Undo/redo with operational transformation

**Infrastructure Improvements:**
- Add automated testing (Jest + React Testing Library)
- Migrate to TypeScript for better type safety
- Set up CI/CD pipeline
- Add error tracking (Sentry, LogRocket)

## Current Blockers
**None** - MVP is complete and deployed

## Active Decisions

### Memory Bank Structure
**Decision:** Use flat structure in `memory-bank/` directory with 6 core files
**Rationale:** Simple, easy to navigate, follows user's rules template
**Status:** Implemented

### Documentation Strategy
**Decision:** Memory Bank contains "why" and "how", code comments contain "what"
**Rationale:** Separation of concerns, Memory Bank is for high-level understanding
**Status:** In progress

## Context for Next Session

### What You Need to Know
1. **Project is production-ready** - All MVP requirements met, deployed, and stable
2. **No active development** - Currently in documentation phase
3. **Memory Bank is the priority** - Ensuring future sessions have full context
4. **Auto-deselection is new** - Recent fix to improve selection UX

### Key Files Modified Recently
- `src/components/Canvas.jsx` - Added `handleRectangleMouseLeave` handler
- `src/components/Rectangle.jsx` - Added `onMouseLeave` prop and handler
- `memory-bank/*` - Created all Memory Bank documentation

### Important State Management Details
The canvas has complex state management with multiple modes:
- **Viewport state:** `viewport` (offsetX, offsetY, zoom)
- **Pan state:** `isPanning`, `panStart`, `panOffset`
- **Draw state:** `isDrawing`, `drawStart`, `drawCurrent`
- **Drag state:** `isDragging`, `dragStart`, `dragOffset`
- **Selection state:** `selectedRectId` (from useCanvas hook)

**Critical pattern:** Use refs (`isDraggingRef`, `selectedRectIdRef`) to access current values in Firestore subscription callbacks without stale closures.

### Interaction Flow
```
User clicks canvas background
  → If Shift/Cmd/Ctrl: start panning
  → Else: start drawing rectangle

User clicks rectangle
  → If locked by another: blocked
  → Else: select it (lock to user)

User drags selected rectangle
  → Optimistic update (instant local change)
  → Throttled Firestore sync (200ms during drag)
  → Final Firestore sync (on mouse up)

User cursor leaves selected rectangle
  → If not dragging: auto-deselect
  → If dragging: keep selected
```

## Questions for Next Session
1. Should we add automated tests? (would improve confidence but add complexity)
2. Should we migrate to TypeScript? (better DX but significant refactor)
3. Should we implement any of the enhancement areas? (circles, delete, multi-select)
4. Are there any edge cases we haven't documented?

## Session Notes

### Performance Characteristics
- ✅ Maintains 60 FPS with 1000+ objects (viewport culling active)
- ✅ Object sync <100ms (tested with multiple users)
- ✅ Cursor sync ~75ms (throttled to prevent spam)
- ✅ No memory leaks during extended testing

### User Experience Observations
- **Auto-deselect feels natural** - Users don't need to click empty space
- **Object locking prevents conflicts** - No race conditions observed
- **Connection status indicator is helpful** - Users know when syncing
- **FPS counter useful for debugging** - Helps identify performance issues

### Technical Observations
- **Viewport culling is critical** - Without it, performance tanks at 200+ objects
- **React.memo is essential** - Rectangle component would re-render constantly
- **Refs prevent stale closures** - Critical for Firestore subscription callbacks
- **Throttling prevents Firestore spam** - Cursor updates would overwhelm database
