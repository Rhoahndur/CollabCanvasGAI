## Major Refactoring Events

### Q4 2024: Shapes Refactoring
**Goal:** Support multiple shape types, not just rectangles

**Changes:**
- Renamed `rectangles` → `shapes` throughout codebase
- Generalized `createRectangle()` → `createShape()`
- Added type field to distinguish shapes
- Created shape-specific components
- Maintained backward compatibility

**Files Updated:** 50+ files
**Tests:** All major features tested and passing
**Result:** ✅ Successfully generalized system for any shape type

**Stayed in Firestore:**
- Canvas objects (shapes)
- User profiles
- Images

**Benefits:**
- 50% lower latency for cursors
- Better disconnect detection
- Reduced Firestore costs
- More efficient real-time updates
