# New Features Summary

## âœ… Task 1: Fit Canvas Button
**Status**: Complete

**What Changed**:
- Replaced preset zoom level buttons (50%, 75%, 100%, etc.) with a single "Fit Canvas" button
- Button zooms out to show the entire canvas with 10% margin
- Centers the canvas in the viewport

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/ZoomControls.jsx` - New "Fit Canvas" button with expand icon
- `src/components/ZoomControls.css` - Styling for the button
- `src/components/Canvas.jsx` - `handleFitCanvas()` function

**How to Use**:
- Click the "Fit Canvas" button in the zoom controls (bottom right)
- Or implement a keyboard shortcut if desired

## âœ… Task 2: Multiple Canvas Projects - Design Plan
**Status**: Complete (Design Only)

**Deliverable**: `MULTI_CANVAS_DESIGN.md`

**Overview**:
Comprehensive design document for implementing multiple canvas projects feature, including:
- User experience goals and flow
- Firebase Realtime Database structure
- Implementation phases (5 phases, 12-16 hours estimated)
- UI/UX mockups and considerations
- Migration strategy for existing users
- Testing checklist
- MVP vs Full Feature breakdown

**Key Decisions to Discuss**:
1. Default behavior for new users
2. Sharing model (email invites vs shareable links)
3. Canvas limits per user
4. Naming convention ("Canvas" vs "Project" vs "Board")
5. Template feature priority
6. Public canvas support

**Ready for review and planning!**

## âœ… Task 3: Object Layer Control
**Status**: Complete

**What Changed**:
- Added `zIndex` property to all shapes (uses timestamp for creation order)
- Shapes now render in correct z-order (back to front)
- Keyboard shortcuts for layer management:
  - **Ctrl/Cmd + ]**: Bring selected shape(s) to front
  - **Ctrl/Cmd + [**: Send selected shape(s) to back

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/Canvas.jsx` - Layer control logic and keyboard shortcuts
- All shape creation functions now include `zIndex: Date.now()`
- Shape rendering sorted by z-index

**How to Use**:
1. Select one or more shapes
2. Press `Ctrl/Cmd + ]` to bring to front
3. Press `Ctrl/Cmd + [` to send to back
4. Works with multi-selection!

**Technical Details**:
- Z-index stored in Firebase for persistence
- Lower zIndex renders first (behind), higher zIndex renders last (in front)
- New shapes get current timestamp as zIndex (always on top)

---

## âœ… Task 4: Undo/Redo Functionality
**Status**: Complete (MVP)

**What Changed**:
- Implemented history tracking for create/delete operations
- Keyboard shortcuts:
  - **Ctrl/Cmd + Z**: Undo last action
  - **Ctrl/Cmd + R** or **Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + Z**: Redo last undone action
- Tracks last 20 actions per user

**Files Created**:
- `src/hooks/useHistory.js` - History management hook

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/Canvas.jsx` - Integrated history tracking

**How to Use**:
1. Create shapes normally
2. Press `Ctrl/Cmd + Z` to undo creation (deletes the shape)
3. Press `Ctrl/Cmd + R` to redo (recreates the shape)
4. Also works for delete operations!

**Limitations** (by design for real-time collaboration):
- Only tracks create/delete operations (not moves, resizes, or style changes)
- Each user has their own undo/redo stack
- Cannot undo other users' actions
- Limited to 20 most recent actions

**Why These Limitations?**
In a real-time collaborative environment:
- Multiple users edit simultaneously
- Firebase is the source of truth (not local state)
- Full undo/redo would require complex operational transformation
- This MVP provides immediate value without complexity

**Future Enhancements** (if needed):
- Track update operations (move, resize, rotate)
- Increase history stack size
- Add visual undo/redo buttons
- Show undo/redo history in UI
