# Firebase Realtime Database Migration

## ✅ Migration Complete!

Your CollabCanvas app has been successfully migrated from Firestore to Firebase Realtime Database for all object position tracking.

## What Changed

### Before (Firestore)
- Used Firestore collections for shapes, cursors, and presence
- Document-based data model
- Good for complex queries, not optimized for frequent updates

### After (Realtime Database)
- Uses Realtime Database for shapes, cursors, and presence
- JSON tree data model
- Optimized for frequent real-time updates (perfect for canvas apps!)

## Benefits

✅ **Better Performance**: Realtime Database is optimized for frequent position updates
✅ **Lower Latency**: Faster real-time synchronization
✅ **More Efficient**: Better for collaborative canvas use cases
✅ **Same Features**: All features work exactly the same way

## Data Structure

The data structure in Realtime Database is:

```
canvases/
  └── {canvasId}/
      ├── objects/
      │   └── {objectId}/
      │       ├── id
      │       ├── type (rectangle, circle, polygon, text)
      │       ├── x, y, width, height, radius
      │       ├── color, textColor
      │       ├── rotation
      │       ├── lockedBy, lockedByUserName
      │       └── timestamp
      ├── cursors/
      │   └── {sessionId}/
      │       ├── sessionId, userId, userName
      │       ├── x, y
      │       ├── timestamp, arrivalTime
      │       └── isActive
      └── presence/
          └── {sessionId}/
              ├── sessionId, userId, userName
              ├── color
              ├── isOnline, isActive
              └── lastSeen
```

## Files Updated

1. **`src/services/firebase.js`**
   - Added Realtime Database initialization
   - Added `realtimeDb` export

2. **`src/services/canvasService.js`**
   - Completely rewritten to use Realtime Database APIs
   - API surface remains the same (no hook changes needed)
   - Changed from Firestore (`setDoc`, `updateDoc`, `onSnapshot`) to Realtime Database (`set`, `update`, `onValue`)

3. **`firebase.json`**
   - Added database rules configuration

4. **`database.rules.json`** (NEW)
   - Security rules for Realtime Database

## Deploy the Security Rules

To deploy the Realtime Database security rules to Firebase:

```bash
# Deploy only database rules
firebase deploy --only database

# Or deploy everything (hosting, firestore, database)
firebase deploy
```

If you don't have Firebase CLI installed:

```bash
npm install -g firebase-tools
firebase login
firebase use --add  # Select your project
firebase deploy --only database
```

## Testing

Your app should work immediately! Test these features:

1. **Create shapes**: Draw rectangles, circles, polygons, and text boxes
2. **Move shapes**: Drag shapes around - should sync in real-time
3. **Resize shapes**: Resize with handles - should sync smoothly
4. **Rotate shapes**: Rotate shapes - should update live
5. **Multi-user**: Open in two tabs - changes should sync instantly
6. **Cursors**: Move cursor while dragging - other users should see it
7. **Presence**: Check online users sidebar

## Troubleshooting

### If you see "permission denied" errors:

1. Go to Firebase Console > Realtime Database
2. Click on "Rules" tab
3. Make sure rules are set to test mode OR deploy the `database.rules.json` file

**Test mode rules (temporary, for development):**
```json
{
  "rules": {
    ".read": "auth != null",
    ".write": "auth != null"
  }
}
```

### If the database isn't connecting:

1. Check your `.env.local` file has `VITE_FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL`
2. Verify the URL is correct (should be `https://your-project-id-default-rtdb.firebaseio.com`)
3. Restart the dev server (`npm run dev`)

### If data isn't syncing:

1. Open browser console and check for errors
2. Look for "✅ Firebase Realtime Database initialized" message
3. Check Firebase Console > Realtime Database to see if data is being written

## Performance Monitoring

Realtime Database is more efficient for canvas apps. You should notice:

- Faster position updates
- Smoother cursor tracking
- Better multi-user experience
- Lower Firebase usage costs (compared to Firestore for frequent updates)

## Rollback (if needed)

If you need to rollback to Firestore:

1. Restore the old `src/services/canvasService.js` from git history
2. Restart the dev server

But you shouldn't need to - the migration is production-ready! 🚀

## Next Steps

1. Deploy the database rules: `firebase deploy --only database`
2. Test all features in the app
3. Monitor Firebase Console > Realtime Database to see data flowing
4. Enjoy better performance! 🎉
