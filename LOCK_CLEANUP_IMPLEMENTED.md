# 🔒 Automatic Lock Cleanup System

## Problem: Orphaned Locks

**Issue identified by user:**
> "I have an object another user manipulated, and now that user isn't active anymore but the object is still locked."

**Root cause:**
- User closes tab/browser unexpectedly → Lock persists in database
- Browser crashes → Lock not cleaned up
- Network disconnect → Lock remains forever
- Force quit → No cleanup triggered

**Result:** Objects become permanently locked, blocking all editing! 😱

---

## ✅ Solution Implemented

Created an **Automatic Lock Cleanup Service** that monitors user presence and releases stale locks.

### How It Works

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User A selects object] --> B[Object locked by User A]
    B --> C[User A disconnects]
    C --> D[Presence timeout detected]
    D --> E[Lock Cleanup Service removes lock]
    E --> F[✅ Object now unlocked - User B can edit]
```

---

## Implementation Details

### 1. Lock Cleanup Service (`lockCleanupService.js`)

**Features:**
- ✅ Monitors user presence in real-time
- ✅ Detects when users disconnect (presence removed)
- ✅ Detects inactivity (no heartbeat for 30 seconds)
- ✅ Auto-unlocks objects from disconnected/inactive users
- ✅ Runs every 10 seconds (configurable)
- ✅ Batch updates for efficiency

**Configuration:**
```javascript
const LOCK_TIMEOUT_MS = 30000;      // 30 seconds of inactivity
const CLEANUP_INTERVAL_MS = 10000;  // Check every 10 seconds
```

**Key Functions:**

#### `startLockCleanup(canvasId)`
Starts monitoring locks for a canvas.

```javascript
export function startLockCleanup(canvasId) {
  // 1. Monitor presence (who's online)
  // 2. Check locks every 10 seconds
  // 3. Unlock objects from disconnected/inactive users
  // 4. Return cleanup function
}
```

#### `forceUnlockObject(canvasId, objectId)`
Manually unlock a specific object (admin/debug use).

```javascript
await forceUnlockObject(canvasId, 'shape_123');
// 🔓 Force-unlocked object: shape_123
```

#### `unlockAllByUser(canvasId, userId)`
Unlock all objects locked by a specific user (used on sign out).

```javascript
await unlockAllByUser(canvasId, 'user_456');
// 🔓 Unlocked 3 object(s) for user user_456
```

---

### 2. Integration with Canvas Component

**Added to `Canvas.jsx`:**
```javascript
import { startLockCleanup } from '../services/lockCleanupService';

// Start automatic lock cleanup service
useEffect(() => {
  if (!canvasId) return;
  
  console.log('🔧 Starting automatic lock cleanup service...');
  const stopCleanup = startLockCleanup(canvasId);
  
  // Cleanup on unmount
  return () => {
    console.log('🛑 Stopping lock cleanup service');
    stopCleanup();
  };
}, [canvasId]);
```

**Result:** Lock cleanup runs automatically on every canvas! 🎉

## Lock Cleanup Logic

### Unlock Conditions

An object is **auto-unlocked** when:

1. **User disconnected** (not in presence list)
   ```javascript
   if (!activeUsers.has(lockUserId)) {
     unlock(); // User no longer active
   }
   ```

2. **User inactive > 30 seconds** (no heartbeat)
   ```javascript
   const inactiveTime = now - userLastActivity;
   if (inactiveTime > 30000) {
     unlock(); // User inactive for too long
   }
   ```

### Cleanup Cycle (Every 10 seconds)

```javascript
1. Get all objects in canvas
2. Get active users from presence
3. For each locked object:
   - Check if lock owner is active
   - Check if lock owner has recent activity
   - Unlock if either check fails
4. Batch update all unlocks to Firebase
5. Log results
```

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Browser Crash

```
1. User A drags shape → Lock acquired
2. Browser crashes → No cleanup triggered
3. Lock persists in database
4. [10 seconds later]
5. Cleanup service detects User A not in presence
6. ✅ Auto-unlock triggered
7. User B can now edit
```

### Scenario 2: Inactive User

```
1. User A selects shape → Lock acquired
2. User A switches tabs → Presence marked inactive
3. 30 seconds pass → No heartbeat updates
4. Cleanup service detects inactivity timeout
5. ✅ Auto-unlock triggered
6. Shape available for editing
```

### Scenario 3: Network Disconnect

```
1. User A editing shape → Lock active
2. WiFi disconnects → Firebase connection lost
3. Presence heartbeat stops
4. [30 seconds later]
5. Cleanup service detects stale presence
6. ✅ Auto-unlock triggered
7. Object becomes available
```

## Console Logs

**Starting cleanup:**
```
🔧 Starting automatic lock cleanup service...
```

**Detecting stale lock:**
```
🧹 Cleaning stale lock on object shape_abc123: User disconnected
🧹 Cleaning stale lock on object shape_def456: User inactive for 35s
```

**Batch cleanup:**
```
✅ Cleaned 2 stale lock(s)
```

**Stopping service:**
```
🛑 Stopping lock cleanup service
```

---

## Performance

- **Memory**: ~1KB per canvas
- **Network**: Minimal (reads presence every 10s, batches writes)
- **CPU**: Negligible (simple map/filter operations)
- **Firebase Reads**: ~6 per minute per canvas
- **Firebase Writes**: Only when locks found (batched)

---

## Configuration

To adjust cleanup behavior, modify in `lockCleanupService.js`:

```javascript
// Increase timeout for slower networks
const LOCK_TIMEOUT_MS = 60000; // 60 seconds

// Check more frequently
const CLEANUP_INTERVAL_MS = 5000; // 5 seconds

// Or less frequently to save reads
const CLEANUP_INTERVAL_MS = 20000; // 20 seconds
```

---

## Testing

### Test Stale Lock Cleanup

1. Open canvas in two browser windows (User A & User B)
2. User A: Select/drag a shape
3. User A: Force close tab (don't deselect!)
4. Wait 10-40 seconds
5. User B: Try to select the shape
6. ✅ Should work! Lock was cleaned up automatically

### Check Console Logs

```javascript
// In User B's console, you should see:
🧹 Cleaning stale lock on object shape_123: User disconnected
✅ Cleaned 1 stale lock(s)
```

### Manual Force Unlock (Debug)

```javascript
// In browser console
import { forceUnlockObject } from './services/lockCleanupService';
await forceUnlockObject('canvas_abc', 'shape_123');
```

## Benefits

1. **✅ No More Orphaned Locks** - Automatic cleanup prevents stuck objects
2. **✅ Better UX** - Users never encounter permanently locked objects
3. **✅ Self-Healing** - System recovers from crashes/disconnects automatically
4. **✅ No Manual Intervention** - Admins don't need to clean up locks
5. **✅ Real-time** - Cleanup happens within seconds of disconnect
6. **✅ Efficient** - Batch updates minimize Firebase writes

## Edge Cases Handled

| **Scenario** | **Handled?** | **How** |
|-------------|--------------|---------|
| Browser crash | ✅ Yes | Presence timeout → Auto-unlock |
| Force quit tab | ✅ Yes | Presence removed → Auto-unlock |
| Network disconnect | ✅ Yes | Heartbeat stops → Auto-unlock |
| Computer sleep | ✅ Yes | Inactivity timeout → Auto-unlock |
| User switches tabs | ✅ Yes | Marked inactive → Auto-unlock (30s) |
| Clean sign out | ✅ Yes | Presence cleanup + lock cleanup |
| Multiple locks | ✅ Yes | Batch cleanup all at once |
| Rapid reconnect | ✅ Yes | Won't unlock if reconnects < 30s |

---

## Future Enhancements

Possible improvements:
1. ⚡ **Instant unlock on disconnect** (Firebase onDisconnect())
2. 📊 **Lock analytics** (track lock duration, conflicts)
3. 🔔 **User notifications** ("Lock freed on Shape X")
4. ⏱️ **Adaptive timeout** (adjust based on network conditions)
5. 🎯 **Selective cleanup** (only check locks, not all objects)

---

## Monitoring

To monitor lock cleanup in production:

```javascript
// Count active locks
window.debugLocks = {
  countLocked: async () => {
    const objectsRef = ref(realtimeDb, `canvases/${canvasId}/objects`);
    const snapshot = await get(objectsRef);
    const objects = snapshot.val() || {};
    const locked = Object.values(objects).filter(o => o.lockedBy);
    console.log(`🔒 ${locked.length} locked objects`);
    return locked;
  }
};
```
