# Anonymous User Fix

## Problem
You were seeing an "anonymous" user showing as online in your presence sidebar, despite having authentication properly configured with Google and GitHub OAuth.

## Root Cause
The issue was **stale presence data** from an old session where:
1. A user's `displayName` failed to load properly and fell back to "Anonymous User"
2. This data persisted in the Firebase Realtime Database
3. The UI displayed it as "Anonymous" when the `userName` field was empty

Your authentication was **working correctly** - the security rules require `auth != null` for all operations. The anonymous entry was just leftover data.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. **Added Username Validation** (`canvasService.js`)
```javascript
// setUserPresence() now validates userName before storing
if (!userName || userName.trim() === '' || userName === 'Anonymous User') {
  throw new Error('userName is required for presence');
}
```
This prevents any new anonymous users from being stored.

### 2. **Removed Anonymous Fallback** (`useAuth.js`)
```javascript
// Removed the 'Anonymous User' fallback
// Now requires a valid displayName or rejects authentication
const displayName = 
  storedGithubUsername ||
  currentUser.reloadUserInfo?.screenName || 
  githubUsername ||
  currentUser.displayName || 
  currentUser.email?.split('@')[0];

// Added validation
if (!displayName || displayName.trim() === '') {
  console.error('‚ùå Cannot authenticate user without a valid display name');
  setUser(null);
  return;
}
```

### 3. **Enhanced Cleanup Function** (`canvasService.js`)
The `cleanupStalePresence()` function now removes:
- Sessions not online
- Sessions older than 30 seconds
- **Sessions with empty/invalid usernames** (NEW!)

```javascript
const hasInvalidUsername = !session.userName || 
                           session.userName.trim() === '' || 
                           session.userName === 'Anonymous User' ||
                           session.userName === 'Anonymous';
```

### 4. **Added Debug Utility** (`App.jsx`)
Added a global function for manual cleanup:
```javascript
window.__debugCleanup()
```

## How to Verify the Fix

### Automatic Cleanup
The anonymous user should **automatically disappear** the next time someone loads the canvas because:
1. The `usePresence` hook calls `cleanupStalePresence()` on mount
2. The enhanced cleanup now removes entries with invalid usernames

### Manual Cleanup (If Needed)
If you still see the anonymous user:

1. Open your browser's Developer Console (F12)
2. Navigate to your canvas
3. Run:
```javascript
await window.__debugCleanup()
```

You should see:
```
üßπ Manually cleaning up stale presence for canvas: [canvasId]
‚úÖ Cleaned up 1 stale sessions
```

## Testing Steps

1. **Refresh your canvas page**
   - The anonymous user should be automatically cleaned up
   
2. **Try to access without authentication**
   - You should be blocked by the login page
   - No presence data should be created
   
3. **Check the presence sidebar**
   - Should only show authenticated users with valid names

## Prevention
These changes prevent the issue from happening again by:
- ‚úÖ Validating usernames before storing presence
- ‚úÖ Requiring valid displayNames for authentication
- ‚úÖ Automatically cleaning up invalid entries
- ‚úÖ Providing manual cleanup tools for emergencies

## Security Confirmation
Your Firebase security rules are **correctly configured**:
- ‚úÖ Firestore rules require `isAuthenticated()` for all operations
- ‚úÖ Realtime Database rules require `auth != null` for all reads/writes
- ‚úÖ No anonymous authentication is enabled
- ‚úÖ Only Google and GitHub OAuth are allowed

The "anonymous user" was just stale data, not a security breach.

## Files Modified
1. `src/services/canvasService.js` - Added username validation and enhanced cleanup
2. `src/hooks/useAuth.js` - Removed anonymous fallback and added validation
3. `src/App.jsx` - Added debug cleanup utility

**Status**: ‚úÖ Fixed
**Next Action**: Refresh the canvas page - the anonymous user should disappear automatically.
