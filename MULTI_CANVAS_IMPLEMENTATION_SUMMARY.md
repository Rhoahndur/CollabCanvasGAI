## 🏗️ Architecture Changes

### Database Structure

**Before (Single Canvas):**
```
canvases/
  └── main-canvas/
      ├── objects/
      ├── cursors/
      └── presence/
```

**After (Multi-Canvas):**
```
canvases/
  └── {canvasId}/
      ├── metadata/           ← NEW
      ├── permissions/        ← NEW
      ├── objects/
      ├── cursors/
      └── presence/

userCanvases/                 ← NEW
  └── {userId}/
      └── {canvasId}/
          ├── name
          ├── role
          ├── lastAccessed
          └── starred
```

---

## 🎨 User Interface

### New Screens

1. **Canvas Dashboard**
   - Grid or list view of all canvases
   - Search and filter
   - Canvas count and metadata
   - Create new canvas button

2. **Create Canvas Modal**
   - Canvas name input
   - Template selector with 3 options
   - Canvas limit warnings
   - Validation and error handling

3. **Canvas View** (Updated)
   - Added "← Dashboard" back button
   - Receives canvasId prop
   - Loads canvas-specific data

---

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Service Functions

**Canvas Management:**
```javascript
createCanvas(userId, name, template)
getUserCanvases(userId)
updateCanvasMetadata(canvasId, updates)
deleteCanvas(canvasId, userId)
```

**Permissions:**
```javascript
addCanvasPermission(canvasId, userId, role, name)
removeCanvasPermission(canvasId, userId)
updateCanvasAccess(userId, canvasId)
```

**Migration:**
```javascript
autoMigrate(userId, userName)
needsMigration(userId)
getMigrationStatus(userId)
```

### Components

**Dashboard:**
- `CanvasDashboard.jsx` - Main dashboard
- `CanvasCard.jsx` - Individual canvas cards
- `CreateCanvasModal.jsx` - Canvas creation

### Routing

**Simple State-Based Routing:**
```javascript
const [currentView, setCurrentView] = useState('dashboard')
const [currentCanvasId, setCurrentCanvasId] = useState(null)

// Dashboard → Canvas
const handleOpenCanvas = (canvasId) => {
  setCurrentCanvasId(canvasId)
  setCurrentView('canvas')
}

// Canvas → Dashboard
const handleBackToDashboard = () => {
  setCurrentView('dashboard')
  setCurrentCanvasId(null)
}
```

- Editor: Can edit objects (future)
- Viewer: Read-only access (future)

### ✅ User Experience
- Smooth navigation (dashboard ↔ canvas)
- Search and filter canvases
- Grid/list view toggle
- Relative time display ("2h ago")
- Empty states and loading states
- Error handling and validation

### ✅ Data Migration
- Existing users auto-migrate seamlessly
- Preserves all existing canvas data
- Non-destructive and one-time only
- Transparent to users

## 📋 Next Steps (Phase 3)

Based on your feedback, Phase 3 will include:

### Sharing & Collaboration
- [ ] Shareable links (read-only or editable)
- [ ] Email invites to specific users
- [ ] Collaborator management UI
- [ ] Role-based permissions (enforce editor/viewer)

### Dashboard Updates
- [ ] New users start from dashboard (already done!)
- [ ] Canvas templates pre-made (already done!)
- [ ] Max 2 canvases enforced (already done!)

### Not Implementing (Per User Request)
- ❌ Public/unlisted canvases (deferred)

**Estimated Phase 3 Time:** ~2-3 hours
